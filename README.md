1. Introduction:

1.1 Project overview

Our project is a web game, using a unique form of Chinese language, combined with an interesting storyline and a battle mode. 

We hope that this game can bring players a novel game experience and make them feel the charm of Chinese characters, 
so that they are more willing to study Chinese character and culture.

1.2 Objective

Our game will be developed with the help of Godot Engine. 
The system can be roughly divided into two parts, 
the frontend part with a friendly user interface which players can use and interact with the interface, and the backend part, where is the management of the database and many playing systems. 
Our goal is to provide a game with a clear player guide and kindly game experience. 

1.3 System Features

Our system mainly composed 5 parts, 
including login and registration, role moving system, combat system, 
skill system and task system. 
Players can create their own characters and control their movements, 
interact with the environment, battle against NPCs, and more. 
Game manager (GM) can complete the modification of the player's account and character information, 
also can modify the game progress. 
More details of these features will be included in later sections.
